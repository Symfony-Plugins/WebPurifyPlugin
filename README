# WebPurify Plugin

## Introduction
[WebPurify](http://www.webpurify.com) provides a cost-effective real-time profanity filtering service.

This plugin provides *sfWebPurifyProfanityValidator*, which rejects a value if it contains profanity.

Future versions may implement the [other methods](http://www.webpurify.com/profanity/filter/documentation.php) available from WebPurify

## Configuration

Purchase an API key from WebPurify.  You can signup for a test license by entering *localhost* for the IP address.

Add the following to your *app.yml* file:

    all:
        webpurify:
            api_key: YOUR API KEY HERE


To use it in your forms, combine it with the existing validator for a given field by using *sfValidatorAnd*:

    [php]
    $this->validatorSchema['name'] = new sfValidatorAnd(array(
      $this->validatorSchema['name']
      , new WebPurifyProfanityValidator()
    ));

You could also invoke the *LiveCheck* method without the validator by doing this:

    [php]
    $command = new WebPurifyLiveCheckCommand(sfConfig::get('app_webpurify_api_key'), 'Text to check for profanity');
    $isClean = $command->isClean(); //returns TRUE or FALSE
